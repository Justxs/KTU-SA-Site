# KTU-SA-Site
Project Objective – The goal of the project is to enable easy updates of changing information and sharing the latest news for the Kaunas University of Technology Student Union (KTU SA).

Operating Principle – The platform being developed consists of three main parts:

A closed administrative subsystem, with limited accessibility, which can only be accessed by the coordinators of the KTU SA Central Office (CSA) and the chairpersons of faculty student associations (FSA). Access will be granted to users with @ktusa.lt domain email addresses.

A public news and information subsystem, which can be accessed by all users to find the necessary information.

Application Programming Interface (API).

KTU SA CSA coordinators or FSA chairpersons can log in to the system using their @ktusa.lt Google email. Once logged in, they can update existing information (such as the composition of FSA, CSA, and other bodies, contacts, the latest news, and descriptions) and input new information according to categories (events, news). The KTU SA President, upon logging in (president@ktusa.lt), will have the ability to grant or revoke certain permissions for each registered user, for example, to set that "bendrabuciai@ktusa.lt" cannot change FSA information but can edit dormitory information. Unregistered users can view all public information but cannot access the administrative subsystem.
