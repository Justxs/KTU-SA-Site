# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for this Next.js 16.0.0 App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Package
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights@^1.3.1` to dependencies using npm
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json

### 2. Integrated SpeedInsights Component
**Modified:** `app/[lang]/layout.tsx`
- Imported `SpeedInsights` from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after `<Analytics />` and before `<Footer />`

### 3. Linter Auto-fixes
**Modified:** `theme/styles.ts`
- The linter automatically fixed a template string formatting issue when running `npm run lint`
- Changed string concatenation to template literal for better code style

## Implementation Details

Since this project uses:
- Next.js 16.0.0 (newer than 13.5)
- App Router architecture
- Existing Vercel Analytics setup

I implemented SpeedInsights using the recommended approach:
- Import from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` (App Router optimized)
- Placed the component in the main layout file that contains the HTML structure
- Positioned it alongside the existing Analytics component for consistency

## Verification

✓ Package installed successfully
✓ Linter passed with no errors
✓ Code follows existing project patterns and conventions
✓ Lock files updated properly

The SpeedInsights component will now automatically track Web Vitals and performance metrics when deployed to Vercel.
